DiSpect_demo_PhantomI: 

To demonstrate the capability that DiSpect can map the displacement of water 
even in the case of partial voluming when image voxels contain a mix of water spins experiencing a range of displacements, 
in a 3D printed, flow-phantom that forks and mixes flows.

DiSpect_demo_PhantomII: 

To demonstrate retrospective vessel selective imaging, a phantom aiming to mimic a forking vessel structure and perfusion
into several distinct compartments in a water pool was test using an EPI-readout DiSpect

DiSpect_demo_invivo:

The ability of DiSpect to perform retrospective vessel selective perfusion imaging in vivo at multiple mixing times is highlighted
